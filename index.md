## What is Sentiment Analysis?

### Sentiment?
Before understanding what sentiment analysis (SA) is, we have to know what **sentiment** is.

1.  Sentiment = feelings

        - Attitudes
        - Emotions
        - Opinions
2.  Subjective impressions, not facts
3.  Generally, a binary opposition in opinions is assumed
4.  For example, For/against, like/dislike, good/bad, etc.


### Sentiment Analysis?
Then, let's learn what **Sentiment Analysis** is.

1.  Using NLP, statistics, or machine learning methods to extract, identify, 
    or otherwise characterize the sentiment content of a text unit
2.  Sometimes refered to as opinion mining, although the emphasis in this 
    case is on extraction
    
According to [www.lexalytics.com](https://www.lexalytics.com/technology/sentiment), Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. A common use case for this technology is to discover how people feel about a particular topic.


## What Can Sentiment Analysis Do?

### Questions Sentiment Analysis might ask

1.  Is this product review positive or negative?
2.  Is this customer email satisfied or dissatisfied?
3.  Based on a sample of tweets, how are people responding to this ad 
    campaign/product release/news item?
4.  How have bloggers' attitudes about the president changed since the 
    election?


### Other Related Tasks

1.  Information extraction (discarding subjective information)
2.  Question answering (recognizing opinionoriented questions)
3.  Summarization (accounting for multiple viewpoints)
4. “Flame” detection
5.  Identifying child-suitability of videos based on comments
6.  Bias identification in news sources
7.  Identifying (in)appropriate content for ad placement


## Applications of Sentiment Analysis

### Applications in Business Intelligence

1. Question: “Why aren't consumers buying our laptop?”
2. We know the concrete data: price, specs, competition, etc.
3. We want to know subjective data: “the design is tacky,” “customer service was condescending”
4. Misperceptions are also important, e.g. “updated drivers aren't available” (even though they are)
5. It is very difficult to survey customers who didn't buy the company's laptop
6. Instead, you could use SA to:

        - search the web for opinions and reviews of this and competing laptops. Blogs, Epinions, amazon, tweets, etc.
        - create condensed versions or a digest of consensus points 

### Cross Domain Applications

1. Insights and applications from SA have been useful in other areas
        
        – Politics/political science
        – Law/policy making
        – Sociology
        – Psychology

### Sentiment Analysis and Sociology

1. Idea propagation through groups is an important concept in sociology (cf. Rogers 1962, Diffusion of Innovations)
2. Opinions and reactions to ideas are relevant to adoption of new ideas
3. Analyzing sentiment reactions on blogs can give insight to this process


## Challenges in SA

1. People express opinions in complex ways
2. In opinion texts, lexical content alone can be misleading
3. Intra-textual and sub-sentential reversals, negation, topic change common
4. Rhetorical devices/modes such as sarcasm, irony, implication, etc.
