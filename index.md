1.  Sentiment = feelings

        - Attitudes
        - Emotions

Then, let's learn what **Sentiment Analysis** is.

1.  Using NLP, statistics, or machine learning methods to extract, identify, 
    or otherwise characterize the sentiment content of a text unit
2.  Sometimes refered to as opinion mining, although the emphasis in this 
    case is on extraction
    
According to [www.lexalytics.com](https://www.lexalytics.com/technology/sentiment), Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. A common use case for this technology is to discover how people feel about a particular topic.

### Questions Sentiment Analysis might ask

1.  Is this product review positive or negative?
