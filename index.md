## What is Sentiment Analysis?

### Sentiment?

Then, let's learn what **Sentiment Analysis** is.
```markdown
1.  Using NLP, statistics, or machine learning methods to extract, identify, 
    or otherwise characterize the sentiment content of a text unit
2.  Sometimes refered to as opinion mining, although the emphasis in this 
    case is on extraction
```
According to [www.lexalytics.com](https://www.lexalytics.com/technology/sentiment), Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. A common use case for this technology is to discover how people feel about a particular topic.
