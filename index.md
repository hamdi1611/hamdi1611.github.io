## What is Sentiment Analysis?

### Sentiment?
Before understanding what sentiment analysis (SA) is, we have to know what **sentiment** is.
```markdown
1. Sentiment = feelings
    - Attitudes
    - Emotions
    - Opinions
2. Subjective impressions, not facts
3. Generally, a binary opposition in opinions is assumed
4. For example, For/against, like/dislike, good/bad, etc.
```
### Sentiment Analysis?
Then, let's learn what **Sentiment Analysis** is.
```markdown
1. Using NLP, statistics, or machine learning methods to extract, identify, or otherwise characterize the sentiment content of a text unit
2. Sometimes refered to as opinion mining, although the emphasis in this case is on extraction

According to [www.lexalytics.com](https://www.lexalytics.com/technology/sentiment), Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. A common use case for this technology is to discover how people feel about a particular topic.
```
